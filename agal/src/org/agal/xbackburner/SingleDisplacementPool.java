/**
 * SingleDisplacementPool is a concurrent non-blocking random access array list
 * implementation with the sole caveat that element insertions into the list cause
 * "displacement" of the element that was previously at that location, causing that
 * element to relocate to the end of the list rather than shuffling the entire list down.
 * Similarly, mid-list removal causes single element replacement, with the replacement
 * taken from the end of the list. This causes random insertions and removals in the pool
 * to run in constant time, but breaks the traditional predictability of a list (hence the
 * name "pool"). It is appropriate for cases where all objects in the collection are
 * equally valid choices, but where simple queueing behavior is not desirable.
 * <p>
 * For the moment, it operates as a constant capacity array, baking in functionality to
 * allow for array elements to be accessed only within the current number of active
 * elements in the pool.
